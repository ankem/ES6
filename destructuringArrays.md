#Destructuring Arrays

In locations that receive the data we can use patern matching to destructure values.
This can be left side of assaginment opetator or arguments to functions etc.  

**Object Destructuring**

`let obj = {first: 'firstName', last: 'lastName'};
 let {first: f, last: l} = obj;
 // we will have two variables declared and initialized f with firstName and l with secondName`
